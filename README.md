# exceptions1-java

Three solutions for the same problem: verify the dates of check-in and check-out at a hypothetical hotel. The very bad solution was about ifs and elses. The bad solution still use the ifs and elses but inside the method in the class appropriated At the end, the good solution was treat the exceptions using try catch and a custom exception.
